suggestions for improvement:
- The code in App.js is calling the Components. This is ok. However, there are no code submissions for the components themselves. I cannot assess their correctness

suggestions for improvement:
- The Car component should receive carInfo as props, and then use the model from the object. Currently, carModel is being passed as props instead of carInfo.
- App.js isn't present, but the instructions require defining the carinfo object there and passing it as props to the Car component.
- The Garage component should be in a separate file, as indicated in the instructions.

suggestions for improvement:
- The `useEffect` hook should have an empty dependency array to prevent it from running on every render.  Without it, the color update will cause an infinite loop in strict mode.
- The `useEffect` should not update the state immediately, but should do it after 5 seconds as the instructions indicated.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding comments to explain complex logic or state transitions for improved readability.
- The `changeButton` function can be simplified by directly negating the state: `setIsToggleOn(!isToggleOn)`

suggestions for improvement:
- The code is correct in isolation but needs to be evaluated in the context of a larger application and the specific exercises it's intended to address.
- Consider using more descriptive variable names if needed for complex logic.

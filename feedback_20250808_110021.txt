suggestions for improvement:
- In `get_words_from_file`, add error handling (try-except) to gracefully handle file not found errors.  The program currently crashes if 'words.txt' is not found.
- In `get_random_sentence`, consider adding a check to ensure the word list is not empty before attempting to select words. An empty list will cause a runtime error.
- Improve the input validation in `main` to handle non-integer input more robustly.  Currently, a non-integer input will raise a ValueError.  Consider using a loop to repeatedly ask for input until a valid integer is received.
- In Exercise 2, the code directly addresses all aspects of the problem, however, the choice of date is hardcoded. It would be better to accept the birthdate from user input.

suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code snippet only addresses Exercise 2 (Working with JSON).  It's missing the implementation for Exercise 1 (Random Sentence Generator).
- The code should be encapsulated within functions as specified in the instructions for Exercise 2.  Currently, it's just a JSON data structure.
- Error handling (e.g., `try-except` blocks to handle potential `FileNotFoundError` or `KeyError` exceptions) is missing in Exercise 2.  The instructions explicitly mention error handling for Exercise 1, and it's a good practice for Exercise 2 as well.
- Exercise 2 should explicitly show the steps of loading the JSON string, accessing the nested key, adding the new key, and saving the modified JSON to a file. This is not directly shown, it implies the steps, but a complete implementation is required.

suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code is a list of words, not a Python program.  It does not address either Exercise 1 or Exercise 2.
- To solve Exercise 1, you need to write Python code that reads a word list from a file, generates random sentences of a specified length using those words, and handles user input validation.
- To solve Exercise 2, you need to write Python code that parses a JSON string (the sampleJson provided), accesses and modifies a nested key in the JSON data, and saves the modified JSON to a file.

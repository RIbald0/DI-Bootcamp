#Step 1: Create func.py
#Create a file named func.py.
#Define a function inside that file that takes two numbers as arguments, sums them, and prints the result.
#Step 2: Create exercise_one.py
#Create a file named exercise_one.py.
#Import the function from func.py using one of the import syntaxes provided in the instructions.
#Call the imported function with two numbers.

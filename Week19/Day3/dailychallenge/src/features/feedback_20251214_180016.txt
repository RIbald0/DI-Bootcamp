suggestions for improvement:
- Implement the addCategory, editCategory, and deleteCategory actions in the component to fully meet the requirements.
- Consider using a more semantic HTML element than a button for the category selection.  A radio button group or a select element might be more appropriate.
- The styling is inline. While functional, consider using CSS classes for better maintainability.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider creating a separate slice for tasks as described in the instructions to manage tasks and categories separately. This enhances modularity and maintainability.
- Implement selectors for category details by ID as specifically requested (`selectCategoryById`).
- There's no implementation of tasks here, only categories; based on the instructions, you need reducers and actions to manage tasks and their progress, which are missing.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding error handling for when a task is not found during editing or toggling.
- The `selectAllTasks` selector is a simple state access, consider if it's necessary or if direct state access is more appropriate in some cases.
- Add createSlice for Categories

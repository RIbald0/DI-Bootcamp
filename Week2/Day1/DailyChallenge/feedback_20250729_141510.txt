suggestions for improvement:
- The code correctly transforms the matrix string into a 2D list and iterates through columns. However, it doesn't perfectly handle the symbol replacement.  It adds a space after *every* non-alphabetic character, rather than only between alphabetic characters.
- The code could benefit from more descriptive variable names (e.g., `matrix` instead of `Matrix_2d_list`).
- Add error handling for cases where the input string might not be formatted correctly (e.g., uneven rows).
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code successfully converts the `MATRIX_STR` into a 2D list and iterates through it column-wise. It correctly identifies and extracts alphabetic characters.  The symbol replacement is partially correct; it identifies and places spaces but doesn't perfectly adhere to the requirement of placing spaces only between alphabetic characters.  This partially addresses Step 1, Step 2, and Step 3 perfectly and Step 4 partially. Step 5 is fully addressed. 
- readability: The code is generally well-structured and easy to follow.  Variable names could be improved for better clarity.
- performance: The code's performance is efficient for the given input size. The nested loops have a time complexity of O(m*n), where 'm' is the number of rows and 'n' is the number of columns. This is acceptable for this task.
- security: There are no security concerns in this code as it only deals with string manipulation and does not interact with external resources or handle user inputs that could lead to vulnerabilities.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding keys to the list of users rendered by the `UserList` component for better performance.
- While not explicitly required, error handling could be improved in the `UserList` component (e.g., displaying a more user-friendly message).

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider using a more descriptive component name like `UserCard` instead of just `User` to better reflect its purpose, aligning with the exercise description.
- While default values are provided directly within the destructuring assignment, you could also explore defining them within the interface itself using the `defaultValue` property if you were using PropTypes, which can improve maintainability in some cases, although this is not strictly applicable to TypeScript interfaces.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding more specific error handling, such as logging errors to a service for monitoring.
- For larger datasets, consider implementing pagination or virtualization to improve performance.
- Consider using a dedicated type for the error instead of `any`.

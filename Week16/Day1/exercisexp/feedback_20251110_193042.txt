URL: URL: https://github.com/RIbald0/DI-Bootcamp/blob/main/Week16/Day1/exercisexp/src/App.jsx
suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding PropTypes to the UserFavoriteAnimals component to validate the 'animals' prop.
- The code is well-structured, but adding comments could improve readability, especially for complex logic or calculations.
- While not strictly required by the exercise, consider using more descriptive variable names where appropriate for enhanced clarity.

suggestions for improvement:
- This is CSS code, and its correctness depends on how it's used in conjunction with React components. Without the React component code, it's impossible to evaluate its correctness against the exercises. Please provide the corresponding React component code to accurately assess the solution.
- Ensure that the CSS class name used in the React component matches the one defined in the CSS file.
- Consider using more descriptive class names for better maintainability.

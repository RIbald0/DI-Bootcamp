# Exercise 2 : DVD Rental

UPDATE film SET language_id=2 WHERE film_id = 384 or film_id = 8
THE customer table has address_id and store_id as FOREIGN KEYS and this affect INSERT because for instance you cannot create a new customer by making up an address_id. The address_id you use must already exist in the address table.
DROP TABLE customer_review; Easy because no other tables depend on it
